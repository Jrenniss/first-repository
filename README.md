My First GitHub Repository - Jennifer Ryan G00362599

Project Description :
After the creation of a GitHub account and the the setup of a repository,
a number of exercises were given in conjunction with lab exercises.
Those exercises included the creation and modifiction of a number of java files.
At the end of each lab any exercises created or modified were to be pushed back on to 
each individuals GitHub repository.
Two exercises were given just before Easter break to be completed and allow modifications
to be made to necessary flies. Eg- Index.java. These additions were then to be updated on
repositorys of individual GitHub accounts.
